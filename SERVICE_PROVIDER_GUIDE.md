# Service Provider Guide

## Overview
The immiCan platform now supports service providers who can register, manage service requests, and communicate with clients through a messaging system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Service Provider Authentication
- **Registration**: Service providers can create accounts with business information
- **Login**: Secure authentication for service providers
- **User Types**: System distinguishes between "Immigrant" and "ServiceProvider" user types

### 2. Service Provider Dashboard
- **Request Management**: View and manage incoming service requests
- **Request Acceptance**: Accept service requests to enable communication
- **Conversation Overview**: See active conversations with clients

### 3. Messaging System
- **Real-time Communication**: Service providers and clients can message each other
- **Conversation Management**: Organized conversations per service request
- **Message History**: Persistent message storage and retrieval

### 4. Client Integration
- **Request Status**: Clients can see when requests are accepted
- **Messaging Access**: Clients can access conversations after request acceptance
- **Unified Experience**: Seamless integration with existing client features

## Database Schema

### New Tables
1. **conversations**: Links service requests to messaging threads
2. **messages**: Stores individual messages with sender information
3. **service_providers**: Enhanced with user_id for authentication

### Key Relationships
- Service providers are linked to user accounts via `user_id`
- Conversations are created automatically when requests are accepted
- Messages are tied to conversations with sender type identification

## API Endpoints

### Service Provider Endpoints
- `POST /api/service-providers/register` - Register new service provider
- `GET /api/service-providers/{id}/requests` - Get service requests
- `GET /api/service-providers/{id}/conversations` - Get conversations

### Messaging Endpoints
- `GET /api/conversations/{id}/messages` - Get conversation messages
- `POST /api/conversations/{id}/messages` - Send new message
- `POST /api/service-requests/{id}/accept` - Accept request and create conversation

## Frontend Routes

### Service Provider Routes
- `/service-provider-register` - Service provider registration
- `/service-provider-login` - Service provider login
- `/service-provider-dashboard` - Service provider dashboard

### Messaging Routes
- `/conversation/{requestId}` - Conversation interface

## User Flow

### Service Provider Flow
1. Register as service provider with business details
2. Login to access dashboard
3. View incoming service requests
4. Accept requests to enable communication
5. Communicate with clients through messaging interface

### Client Flow
1. Register/login as usual
2. Request services from providers
3. Wait for request acceptance
4. Access conversation interface once accepted
5. Communicate with service provider

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
- Enhanced user registration to support different user types
- Added service provider authentication and profile management
- Implemented messaging system with conversation and message tables
- Added request acceptance workflow with automatic conversation creation

### Frontend Changes
- Created service provider registration and login pages
- Built service provider dashboard with request management
- Implemented conversation interface for messaging
- Updated client dashboard to show messaging options
- Added navigation between client and service provider interfaces

## Security Considerations
- User type validation in login process
- Authorization checks for conversation access
- Sender verification for message sending
- Proper error handling and validation

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time messaging with WebSocket support
- File sharing in conversations
- Push notifications for new messages
- Service provider profile management
- Rating and review system integration
- Advanced conversation features (message status, typing indicators)

## Getting Started

1. **Database Setup**: The new tables are automatically created when the database initializes
2. **Backend**: Start the Flask server - it includes all new endpoints
3. **Frontend**: Start the React development server - all new routes are configured
4. **Testing**: 
   - Register as a service provider
   - Register as a client
   - Request a service from the client dashboard
   - Accept the request from the service provider dashboard
   - Use the messaging interface to communicate

The system is now fully functional with service provider registration, request management, and messaging capabilities!
