---

## **🎯 Demo Overview (15 minutes)**

### **Opening Statement**
*"Today I'll demonstrate the immiCan platform's enterprise-grade security features. This platform connects immigrants with service providers and includes comprehensive security measures that protect against common threats."*

---

## **📋 Demo Script**

### **1. Quick Security Overview (2 minutes)**

**Say**: *"Let me show you the security features we've implemented:"*

**Show**: Security features list
```bash
echo "🛡️  SECURITY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "• Input validation and sanitization"
echo "• SQL injection prevention"
echo "• XSS attack prevention"
echo "• Rate limiting for brute force protection"
echo "• JWT authentication with secure tokens"
echo "• Session management with expiration"
echo "• Real-time security monitoring"
echo "• Comprehensive audit trails"
echo "• Database-backed security logging"
```

**Key Point**: *"We've implemented OWASP-compliant security measures with comprehensive monitoring."*

---

### **2. Live Security Demonstration (8 minutes)**

#### **A. Input Validation Demo (2 minutes)**

**Say**: *"Let me show you how input validation prevents attacks:"*

**Demo 1 - Invalid Email Rejection**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "invalid-email", "full_name": "Test User", "password": "StrongPass123!"}'
```

**Show Result**: `{"ok": false, "msg": "Invalid email format"}`

**Say**: *"The system rejects invalid email formats, preventing malformed data from entering the system."*

**Demo 2 - Weak Password Rejection**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "full_name": "Test User", "password": "weak"}'
```

**Show Result**: `{"ok": false, "msg": "Password must be at least 8 characters long"}`

**Say**: *"Password strength requirements are enforced, ensuring users create secure passwords."*

#### **B. SQL Injection Prevention Demo (2 minutes)**

**Say**: *"Now let me demonstrate SQL injection prevention:"*

**Demo - SQL Injection Attempt**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@example.com\'; DROP TABLE users_login;--", "full_name": "Test User", "password": "StrongPass123!"}'
```

**Show Result**: `{"ok": false, "msg": "Invalid email format"}`

**Say**: *"SQL injection attempts are blocked by input validation. The system treats the injection as an invalid email format and rejects it."*

#### **C. Rate Limiting Demo (2 minutes)**

**Say**: *"Let me show you rate limiting in action:"*

**Demo - Brute Force Protection**:
```bash
echo "Making 12 login attempts with wrong password..."
for i in {1..12}; do
  echo "Request $i:"
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "wrongpassword"}' \
    -w "Status: %{http_code}\n"
done
```

**Show Result**: First 9-10 requests get 401, then 429 Rate Limit Exceeded

**Say**: *"After 10 failed attempts, the system blocks further requests for 5 minutes, preventing brute force attacks."*

#### **D. JWT Authentication Demo (2 minutes)**

**Say**: *"Now let me demonstrate JWT authentication:"*

**Demo 1 - Protected Endpoint Without Token**:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5001/api/users/test-user-id/service-requests
```

**Show Result**: `{"msg": "Authentication token is required", "ok": false}`

**Demo 2 - Login to Get Token**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "StrongPass123!"}'
```

**Show Result**: Returns JWT tokens and session ID

**Demo 3 - Access Protected Endpoint With Token**:
```bash
# Use the token from previous response
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5001/api/users/$user_id/service-requests" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token"
```

**Show Result**: `{"ok": true, "service_requests": []}`

**Say**: *"Protected endpoints require valid JWT tokens. Without a token, access is denied. With a valid token, users can access their data."*

---

### **3. Security Monitoring Demonstration (3 minutes)**

#### **A. Real-Time Security Events**

**Say**: *"Let me show you the comprehensive security monitoring:"*

**Demo - Security Events Log**:
```bash
docker exec -i immican_db psql -U appuser -d appdb -c "
SELECT 
    event_type,
    LEFT(description, 50) as description_short,
    ip_address,
    severity,
    created_at
FROM security_events 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;"
```

**Show Result**: All API requests logged with metadata

**Say**: *"Every API request is logged with full metadata including IP address, user agent, and timestamp."*

#### **B. Failed Login Tracking**

**Demo - Failed Login Attempts**:
```bash
docker exec -i immican_db psql -U appuser -d appdb -c "
SELECT 
    action_type,
    LEFT(description, 50) as description_short,
    created_at
FROM audit_log 
WHERE action_type = 'LOGIN_FAILURE' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;"
```

**Show Result**: Failed login attempts tracked

**Say**: *"All failed login attempts are tracked and logged for security analysis."*

#### **C. Active Sessions Monitoring**

**Demo - Active Sessions**:
```bash
docker exec -i immican_db psql -U appuser -d appdb -c "
SELECT 
    id,
    user_id,
    email,
    ip_address,
    created_at,
    expires_at,
    CASE 
        WHEN expires_at > NOW() THEN 'ACTIVE'
        ELSE 'EXPIRED'
    END as status
FROM active_sessions 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;"
```

**Show Result**: Active sessions with expiration times

**Say**: *"All user sessions are tracked with expiration times and IP addresses for security monitoring."*

---

### **4. Security Architecture Overview (2 minutes)**

#### **A. Database Security Tables**

**Say**: *"Let me show you the comprehensive security database structure:"*

**Show**: Security tables
```bash
docker exec -i immican_db psql -U appuser -d appdb -c "
SELECT 
    table_name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = t.table_name) as column_count
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('security_events', 'active_sessions', 'suspicious_activities', 'jwt_tokens', 'rate_limits', 'audit_log')
ORDER BY table_name;"
```

**Say**: *"We have dedicated tables for security events, sessions, suspicious activities, JWT tokens, rate limits, and audit logs."*

#### **B. Security Metrics**

**Demo - Real-Time Security Metrics**:
```bash
docker exec -i immican_db psql -U appuser -d appdb -c "
SELECT 
    'Security Events (Last Hour)' as metric,
    COUNT(*) as value
FROM security_events 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Active Sessions',
    COUNT(*)
FROM active_sessions 
WHERE expires_at > NOW()
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Failed Logins (Last Hour)',
    COUNT(*)
FROM audit_log 
WHERE action_type = 'LOGIN_FAILURE' 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';"
```

**Show Result**: Real-time security metrics

**Say**: *"We have real-time security metrics showing current threat levels and system status."*
